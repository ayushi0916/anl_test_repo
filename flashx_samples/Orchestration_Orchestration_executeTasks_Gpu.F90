!! @brief Execute a task function with the GPU-only thread team configuration
!!
!! @details <missing details>
!! Use the runtime to execute the given task function with the GPU-only thread team
!! configuration.  Upon termination, the task function will have been applied to
!! all leaf blocks by the GPUs assigned to each MPI process' runtime instance and in
!! accord with the given runtime configuration values.  The order in which the
!! task function is applied to blocks is determined at runtime and should therefore
!! be considered as arbitrary.
!!
!! @note
!! This subroutine is only available in the Orchestration unit's public interface
!! if the Milhoja Orchestration implementation is in use and a GPU-compatible
!! runtime backend has been specified.  Therefore, it effectively has no stub
!! implementation.  Refer to the Orchestration unit's documentation for more
!! information.
!!
!! @todo This interface is presently restricted to leaf blocks only because the
!! runtime implementation is limited in this way.  Once the runtime functions with
!! AMR, this interface will need to include a specification of which blocks to
!! apply the TF to as well as if tiling should be used.
!! @todo For logging purposes, this interface should accept a name for the task
!! function.
